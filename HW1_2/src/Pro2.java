           This is a program to calculate the compound monthly interest. The program asks user to
           enter value of principle (p), annual interest rate (r) and time (t) and
           finally calculates the compound interest by following formula.

                 ùê¥=ùëÉ‚àó(1+ùëü12)^t

            A: Final amount
            P: Initial principle balance
            r: interest rate
            t: number of time periods (in terms of months)
